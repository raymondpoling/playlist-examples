# playlist-examples
Different versions of similar code in different languages

Languages:
- playlist.php is obviously php
- playlist.py is obviously python
- playlist.cljx is clojure java/javascript generic code (compiles a version for each target, although should be outdated)
- Playlist.lhs is literate Haskell. The literate part is done in LaTeX and might be hard on the eyes.

Originally writing in Haskell, rewritten for other languages as I played with different implementations (most in incomplete states).
